## [Income Inequality Exploration](https://larrylp2.github.io/world_bank_data_analysis/)

## Using Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook, I hoped to answer some questions I've had from competing in Model United Nations:
- Can a nation's level of income inequality be determined by other factors?
- Are wealthier nations more prone to economic disparities? 
- Do oil and mineral exporting nations suffer from greater amounts of income inequality than other nations?
