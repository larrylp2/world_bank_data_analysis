## Income Inequality Exploration

## Using Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook, I hoped to answer questions I developed as I competed in Model United Nations:
### Can a nation's level of income inequality be determined by other factors?
### Are wealthier nations more prone to ecoonomic disparities? 
### Do oil and mineral exporting nations suffer from greater amounts of income inequality than other nations?
